# Music Sequencing

The music in Myst4 is similar to Myst3 in that it uses sequencing to create music cues that offer more variety for a long period of time compared to a fixed piece of music looped endlessly.

# Sequence Files

Each music track / cue has a sequence file (.seq) located in the main sound.m4b in the sequence folder.
The game shipped with 48 files of these files (assuming no variation between versions).
