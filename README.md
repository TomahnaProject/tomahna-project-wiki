# Tomahna Project Wiki

This is the source repository for the project wiki.

[Visit the wiki here.](https://tomahnaproject.github.io/tomahna-project-wiki/)

## Editing the Wiki

Edit the pages inside the docs folder to add or change information.

This wiki makes use of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). When editing the wiki, you should locally build it to ensure there are no errors.

This requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

`pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin`

Running `mkdocs serve` starts up a server at 127.0.0.1:8000 with the docs site. Use this for testing.

[MkDocs reference for writing document pages.](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)

[Material for MkDocs reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)

Reference for how these pages were setup, and how you can edit and view the wiki locally before pushing edits can be found [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20)
